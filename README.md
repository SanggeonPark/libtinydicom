## Introduce
A DICOM tag library for C++/STL

Related in DICOM tag file (.DCM) read and write library is too far to get free.
So I made this to read and write DCM files for free and tiny !
It is still prototype and need to be enhanced.

## Known VR (WORD)
See source code of dicomdictinary.cpp.
I have gathering more VR information, but it is really narrow to know. Absolutely limited.
